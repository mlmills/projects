HW #2:
My boyfriend/study partner, James Yalowitz and I created this same site together. Our code is most likely exaclty the same. He already submitted his and I am a couple days late to submit as I was having some github issues. He told me he didn't mention we worked on ours together, but if you need to ask him, please feel free.

You will find most of our hw to be similar as we are working through this class together, helping each other as we go along.
